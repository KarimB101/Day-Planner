      <p>
      I am 24 years old and I hope to thrive in this field due to feeling burned out working in the healthcare like many others. 
      I do like the idea of being able to work from home although an office environment I believe would suit me as well. 
      Hopefully I am able to pick up the material quickly as I am used to having a heavy work load and also hope to form some genuine relationships with some of my classmates and instructors.
